# SAFE - Secure Automated Fast Election-verification  

In the Indian voting system, one of the primary causes of **delays and long queues** at polling stations is the **manual verification of voters** and **checking their names in the voter list**. Currently, polling officers manually verify Voter IDs, search for names in printed electoral lists, and issue voter slips all of which **consume time and lead to inefficiencies**.  

**SAFE** proposes a **technological enhancement** to the existing system by **integrating biometric authentication and facial recognition** for voter verification. This ensures that **voters are verified quickly and securely** without disrupting the existing Voting Process.
